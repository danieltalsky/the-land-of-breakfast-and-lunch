Some would say that life is like a box of metaphors.  I would not say that.  I would say life is a land of metaphors.  You come to this land perhaps from a hidden door in the back of a piece of furniture, perhaps from a door in a dream.  Either way, you find yourself here.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
~ a land can contain both ~ by Daniel Talsky
Release 12 / Serial number 200328 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

The Path
You are at the beginning of a path.  It is plain, even homely.  It leads forward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  If you "walk forward" you will follow the path.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

The Land of Unrealized Possibilities
You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is a sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.  The Seaside Path leads forward, towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.

You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), and a TV here.

You are in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  You stand near the edge of the bay, and there is a sailing ship moored here with thick and aged ropes tied to a bollard.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities, a place you're not sure you want to be.  Forward, Sequel Path leads to The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see a swarthy hippie seaperson here.

The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening
You are in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.  There is a launchpad here, on which sits a large, 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red. The Sequel Path leads backwards towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  Ahead of you, The Anticlimactic Path probably leads somewhere really amazing.

You can see a launchpad and a rocket here.

The Land of Unlaunched Vessels
You are in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  You stand near the edge of the bay, and there is a sailing ship moored here with thick and aged ropes tied to a bollard.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities, a place you're not sure you want to be.  Forward, Sequel Path leads to The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see a swarthy hippie seaperson here.

He's black all over except the tips of his front paws, and the bottom of his chin and belly, giving him the appearance of permanent formalwear.  He is a very handsome dog, and his honoric (Mister) is never abbreviated as "Mr.".  You can call him "Mister" or "Tuxedo", but not "Mr." or "Mr. Tuxedo".  It's for a good reason, I promise.

Mister Tuxedo lives only to leap, cavort, and catch a thrown ball.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

&gt;[2] f

Hopeful Path
You are on the hopeful path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  Forward is The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.

&gt;[3] f

The Land of Unrealized Possibilities
You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.

You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), a TV, and a kiddie ride here.

&gt;[4] open box
(the toy box)
You open the toy box, revealing a wooden block, a skinny naked plastic doll, a closed jack-in-the-box, a lite-brite, a coloring book, a small heart shaped locket, and a small hobby horse.

&gt;[5] x doll
The face of the skinny plastic doll is forever frozen in an expression of bored self-satisfaction.  Its long naked arms and legs bend and articulate, but not much.  Its breasts are idealized, yet awkwardly shaped, like rounded pyramids.  It has nylon synthetic hair that cascades stiffly around its shoulders.

&gt;[6] x hair
The hair is really tiny tufts of nylon that poke out of holes in the doll's head.

&gt;[7] x breasts
They are merely designed to fill out a miniature blouse, and look very unnatural unclothed.

&gt;[8] bend doll
Taken.

You twist the doll into a few unlikely positions, as if getting ready to horrify an imaginary younger sister.  Then, you are bored and bend her back to her awkwardly stiff standing pose.

&gt;[9] x jack-in-the-box
The jack-in-the-box is a brightly painted tin cube, and actually looks to be some sort of antique.  It is detailed with flames, and written on the back and front are the words "diable en boîte".  It has a tightly fitted lid on top, and a small wire and wood hand crank on one side.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

&gt;[2] f

Hopeful Path
You are on the hopeful path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  Forward is The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.

&gt;[3] f

The Land of Unrealized Possibilities
You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is a sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.  The Seaside Path leads forward, towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.

You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), and a TV here.

&gt;[4] f

Seaside Path
You are on the seaside path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Forward is The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.

&gt;[5] f

The Land of Unlaunched Vessels
You are in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  You stand near the edge of the bay, and there is a sailing ship moored here with thick and aged ropes tied to a bollard.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities, a place you're not sure you want to be.  Forward, Sequel Path leads to The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see a swarthy hippie seaperson here.

&gt;[6] ask seaperson about bollard
"Ah yeah, that's a mooring bollard."

&gt;[7] ask seaperson about fluyt
"Yes, that's The Chimera.  It's a Dutch cargo fluyt.  Due to a trade dispute it's temporarily moored here since it can't legally be moored at any real harbor.  I am required to ensure it isn't stolen and that no one boards it, but otherwise I don't have much else to do.  That's ok though, I do not mind resting in the sun day after day.  I've worked hard all my life and I'm fine being right here in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  If The Chimera ever launched, I believe we'd have to change the name of the place."

&gt;[8] ask seaperson about trade dispute
"The trade dispute began about four years ago, and The Chimera has been moored here in this temporary location nearly that entire time.  First time I've ever been paid NOT to sail.  I think someone in The Land of Taxable Interest got a little rowdy, and someone in The Land of Sensible Tariffs took exception.

&gt;[2] eat breakfast
(Breakfast)
You sit down for a moment and eat breakfast.  It is delicious but you still don't quite feel satisfied.

&gt;[3] eat lunch
(Lunch)
Lunch was wonderful.  Your stomach feels like a puzzle, where the final piece has finally been snapped into place.  You now feel as if you could take on the world.

The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening
You are in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.  There is a launchpad here, on which sits a large, 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red. The Sequel Path leads backwards towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  Ahead of you, The Anticlimactic Path probably leads somewhere really amazing.

You can see a launchpad and a rocket here.

&gt;[12] open hatch
You open the hatch.

&gt;[13] climb ladder
You pull yourself into the rocket.

The Inside of the Parked Rocket
You are within the smooth walls of the rocket.  It is very plain here, out the porthole window you can see the sky, and out the hatch you can see The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see a cockpit, a big metal unit containing a captain's chair and a control panel here.

&gt;[14] press red button
It's natural to expect blastoff immediately.  Instead, the hatch door whirrs slowly shut, coming to a solid clang.  You have just enough time to realize that you could buckle yourself into the captain's chair and you do.  Just in time, as you feel a tremendous slow and steady thrust of force wrap itself around you as the sky begins to move in the porthole window.  For just one moment you swear you can see The Land of Breakfast and Lunch streak by the window.  Finally, the sky begins to darken, and all sound becomes only a vibration.  The deep, dark void of space is with you.  You absentmindedly unbuckle the webbing securing you to the seat, and you feel free to move about the interior.

The Deep, Dark Void of Space
You are inside the rocket as it cruises very slowly through the deep, dark void of space.  Outside the porthole window is the deep, dark void of space covered over with a curtain of stars.

&gt;[15] press blue button
Whoosh.  You thought maybe the engine engaged again, but something else already did.  It bent space softly around you, and, maybe the rocket moved a little.  Like with a soft whoosh.  It happened in less than a second.  Now, you think you're somewhere else.

Elbow Nebula
You are inside the rocket as it cruises very slowly through the deep, dark void of space.  Outside the porthole window is the deep, dark void of space covered over with a curtain of stars.

You notice something unusual outside the porthole window.

You are inside the rocket as it cruises very slowly through the deep, dark void of space.  Outside the porthole window is the deep, dark void of space covered over with a curtain of stars.

You notice something unusual outside the porthole window.

You can see a lite-brite (in which is a last page from the coloring book, black, and printed with some kind of glow-in-the-dark ink) and a cockpit, a big metal unit containing a captain's chair and a control panel here.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

&gt;[2] eat breakfast
(Breakfast)
You sit down for a moment and eat breakfast.  It is delicious but you still don't quite feel satisfied.

&gt;[3] eat lunch
(Lunch)
Lunch was wonderful.  Your stomach feels like a puzzle, where the final piece has finally been snapped into place.  You now feel as if you could take on the world.

&gt;[4] f

Hopeful Path
You are on the hopeful path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  Forward is The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.

&gt;[5] f

The Land of Unrealized Possibilities
You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is a sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.  The Seaside Path leads forward, towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.

You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), and a TV here.

&gt;[6] f

Seaside Path
You are on the seaside path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Forward is The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.

&gt;[7] f

The Land of Unlaunched Vessels
You are in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  You stand near the edge of the bay, and there is a sailing ship moored here with thick and aged ropes tied to a bollard.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities, a place you're not sure you want to be.  Forward, Sequel Path leads to The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see a swarthy hippie seaperson here.

&gt;[8] f

Sequel Path
You are on the sequel path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  Forward is The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

&gt;[9] f

The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening
You are in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.  There is a launchpad here, on which sits a large, 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red. The Sequel Path leads backwards towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  Ahead of you, The Anticlimactic Path probably leads somewhere really amazing.

You can see a launchpad and a rocket here.

&gt;[10] open hatch
You open the hatch.

&gt;[11] climb ladder
You pull yourself into the rocket.

The Inside of the Parked Rocket
You are within the smooth walls of the rocket.  It is very plain here, out the porthole window you can see the sky, and out the hatch you can see The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see a cockpit, a big metal unit containing a captain's chair and a control panel here.

&gt;[12] press red button
It's natural to expect blastoff immediately.  Instead, the hatch door whirrs slowly shut, coming to a solid clang.  You have just enough time to realize that you could buckle yourself into the captain's chair and you do.  Just in time, as you feel a tremendous slow and steady thrust of force wrap itself around you as the sky begins to move in the porthole window.  For just one moment you swear you can see The Land of Breakfast and Lunch streak by the window.  Finally, the sky begins to darken, and all sound becomes only a vibration.  The deep, dark void of space is with you.  You absentmindedly unbuckle the webbing securing you to the seat, and you feel free to move about the interior.

The Deep, Dark Void of Space
You are inside the rocket as it cruises very slowly through the deep, dark void of space.  Outside the porthole window is the deep, dark void of space covered over with a curtain of stars.

&gt;[13] press blue button
Whoosh.  You thought maybe the engine engaged again, but something else already did.  It bent space softly around you, and, maybe the rocket moved a little.  Like with a soft whoosh.  It happened in less than a second.  Now, you think you're somewhere else.

That's it.  Surely you should be able to operate a spacecraft with only those controls?  (You look on the front for a button marked "Fire Laser" or "Warp 7" but those buttons are not on the control panel or anywhere else inside the ship.)

It's natural to expect blastoff immediately.  Instead, the hatch door whirrs slowly shut, coming to a solid clang.  You have just enough time to realize that you could buckle yourself into the captain's chair and you do.  Just in time, as you feel a tremendous slow and steady thrust of force wrap itself around you as the sky begins to move in the porthole window.  For just one moment you swear you can see The Land of Breakfast and Lunch streak by the window.  Finally, the sky begins to darken, and all sound becomes only a vibration.  The deep, dark void of space is with you.  You absentmindedly unbuckle the webbing securing you to the seat, and you feel free to move about the interior.

The Deep, Dark Void of Space
You are inside the rocket as it cruises very slowly through the deep, dark void of space.  Outside the porthole window is the deep, dark void of space covered over with a curtain of stars.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

The Land of Unrealized Possibilities
You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.

You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), a TV, and a kiddie ride here.

You are in the The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  You stand near the edge of the bay, and there is a vessel moored here with thick and aged ropes tied to a bollard.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities, a place you're not sure you want to be.  Forward, Sequel Path leads to The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see an a swarthy hippie seaperson here.

The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening
You are in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.  There is a launchpad here, on which sits a large, 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red. Sequel Path leads backwards towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels

You can see a launchpad and a Rocket here.

&gt;[8] x launchpad
The launchpad appears to be just a featureless steel box set into the ground.  Only a few inches of it protrude up to support the rocket.  It has a mirrory shine, as if the rocket had never been launched.

On the launchpad sits a 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red.  Close your eyes and imagine the idea of a cartoon rocket (ok, now open them again) and that's what you've got here.  It's got a bubble of a porthole, curvy fins, and an incredibly phallic body, coming to a point with an extra couple of spheres on the tip of the nose cone.  There is a small, retractable ladder that leads to the hatch.

&gt;[10] x porthole
The porthole is the single window of the rocket, and it bubbles out from the body of the rocket so when you're inside, you can see a wider vista.  It has a pleasant curve to it.

&gt;[11] x bubble
It's not literally a bubble, it's just a bubble-like window attached to the rocket.

&gt;[12] x fins
There are two fins opposite each other, evenly spaced around the rocket.  At first it looks like the rocket rests on them, but really they're just inches above the launchpad.  They each have a pleasing curve to them and terminate in what looks like a jet engine.

&gt;[13] x hatch
The hatch is a small door in the rocket.  It has a hinge on the side, and a handle that looks like the locking handle on the door of a 1950's refrigerator.

&gt;[14] x ladder
You look at the retractable ladder very closely indeed, and to be completely honest, it looks about how you'd expect.  You think for a moment that there might be something slightly special about it but then, upon looking just a little closer, you see that there isn't.

&gt;[15] x cone
The nose cone follows the natural curve of the body of the rocket, coming to a point, and sprouting a single pole antenna with little spheres on it.

&gt;[16] x spheres
The middle sphere is the largest, the top sphere is the smallest, and the bottom sphere is halfway between the size of the two other spheres.  It looks pretty cool in a 1950's sort of way.

&gt;[17] retract ladder
The ladder retracts automatically when the rocket is getting ready to launch.

&gt;[18] climb ladder
The hatch is closed.

&gt;[19] climb ladder
The hatch is closed.

&gt;[20] open hatch
You open the hatch.

&gt;[21] climb ladder
You pull yourself into the rocket.

The Inside of the Parked Rocket
You are within the smooth walls of the rocket.  It is very plain here, out the porthole window you can see the sky, and out the hatch you can see The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see a the cockpit, a big metal unit containing a captain's chair and a control panel here.

It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

&gt;[4] x ride
Off to the side a little ways is a mechanical kiddie ride.  It's a big (to a child) yellow humvee with cartoon human eyes where the headlights should be.  It's anchored to a diamond plate platform and looks to have stopped mid-tilt.

Mounted on a post next to it is a coin box showing the coin denomination necessary to make it run: 25¢, or one U.S. quarter dollar piece.

There were once two of these rides outside every grocery store in America.  Whether they died out because kids collectively realized they weren't fun, or just liability, you're surprised to see this one here.

The kiddie ride is currently switched off.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

It's a single penny, so grimy you can't read the date.  It looks older than 1982, which means it's made of solid copper, but coated in rust and grime.

The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities, a place you're not sure you want to be.  Forward, Sequel Path leads to The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You are in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.  There is a launchpad here, on which sits a large, 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red. The Sequel Path leads backwards towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  Ahead of you, The Anticlimactic Path probably leads somewhere really amazing.

You are in The Land Behind the Liquor Store.  It's underwhelming.  You've got your standard collection of broken down boxes, a dumpster, and a stack of pallets.  Behind you, the anticlimactic path leads to The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.  Ahead of you, The Path Around the Liquor Store leads to The Land in Front of the Liquor Store.

The Path Around the Liquor Store
You're on the path around the liquor store.  You see the side of the liquor store on one side and a fence on the other side.

&gt;[13] f

The Land in Front of the Liquor Store
The Land in Front of the Liquor Store looks mostly abandoned, and you feel a slight sense of disappointment and dread here.  The liquor store is closed, looks like permanently, and there's just a weird kiddie ride here.  There are marks on the sidewalk where some other metal vending machines were, but it looks like they've been carted away.  Only the kiddie ride remains.  It's pretty depressing here, but if you continue to go forward, the Idyllic Path leads to The Land of Puppy Cardiovascular health, which is the H.

You can see a kiddie ride here.

&gt;[14] unplug kiddie ride
You pull the industrial strength cord out of the liquor store wall.

The Land in Front of the Liquor Store looks mostly abandoned, and you feel a slight sense of disappointment and dread here.  The liquor store is closed, looks like permanently, and there's just a weird kiddie ride here.  There are marks on the sidewalk where some other metal vending machines were, but it looks like they've been carted away.  Only the kiddie ride remains.  It's pretty depressing here, but if you continue to go forward, the Idyllic Path leads to The Land of Puppy Cardiovascular health, which is the H.

You can see a lite-brite (empty) and a kiddie ride here.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.

(Breakfast)
You sit down for a moment and eat breakfast.  It is delicious but you still don't quite feel satisfied.

&gt;[3] eat lunch
(Lunch)
Lunch was wonderful.  Your stomach feels like a puzzle, where the final piece has finally been snapped into place.  You now feel as if you could take on the world.

You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.

You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), a TV, and a kiddie ride here.

It's natural to expect blastoff immediately.  Instead, the hatch door whirrs slowly shut, coming to a solid clang.  You have just enough time to realize that you could buckle yourself into the captain's chair and you do.  Just in time, as you feel a tremendous slow and steady thrust of force wrap itself around you as the sky begins to move in the porthole window.  For just one moment you swear you can see The Land of Breakfast and Lunch streak by the window.  Finally, the sky begins to darken, and all sound becomes only a vibration.  The deep, dark void of space is with you.  You absentmindedly unbuckle the webbing securing you to the seat, and you feel free to move about the interior.

You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.

You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), a TV, and a kiddie ride here.

&gt;[4] open toy box
You open the toy box, revealing a wooden block, a skinny naked plastic doll, a closed jack-in-the-box, a lite-brite, a coloring book, a small heart shaped locket, and a small hobby horse.

&gt;[5] x jack-in-the-box
The jack-in-the-box is a brightly painted tin cube, and actually looks to be some sort of antique.  It is detailed with flames, and written on the back and front are the words "diable en boîte".  It has a tightly fitted lid on top, and a small wire and wood hand crank on one side.

&gt;[6] turn crank
You grasp the little wooden ball and begin to turn the crank as you hold the jack-in-the-box steady.  A dark little tune plinks its way out, echoing forth from the little tin box.  It's not "all around the mulberry bush" or any song you recognize, so you don't quite expect it when its last note ends, and the spring-loaded doll within leaps out with surprising agility.  You jump a tiny bit, in spite of yourself.  The devil doll looks pleased.

The jack-in-the-box is a brightly painted tin cube, and actually looks to be some sort of antique.  It is detailed with flames, and written on the back and front are the words "diable en boîte".  Its tin lid is popped open, revealing a small fabric devil puppet.

&gt;[8] close jack-in-the-box

You shove the devil doll into the body of the box, and shut the lid with a satisfying snap.

You shove the devil doll into the body of the box, and shut the lid with a satisfying snap.

        <command xml:space="preserve">look coloring book</command>
        <result xml:space="preserve">The title of the coloring book reads "Horse Party!"  Inside are drawings of horses in pastoral settings, but with festive party hats.  They are doing no discernable celebrating.  Seems a little demented, really.  A couple of the pictures are colored neatly, and one is very carefully colored, as if by an adult.

        <result xml:space="preserve">You're looking at a white plastic case with a black plastic pegboard covering one side.   Attached to the back is a black power cord.  If you've seen one before, you know that it's got a little light inside, and usually comes with sheets of black construction paper to affix to the pegboard.  Usually comes with dozens of transparent, colored pegs too.  Push them into the pegboard to make little light-up pictures.  You don't see any of that stuff though.

You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.

You can see a toy box (in which are a wooden block, a skinny naked plastic doll, a closed jack-in-the-box, a lite-brite, a coloring book, a small heart shaped locket (closed), and a small hobby horse), a couch (on which is your brother), a TV, and a kiddie ride here.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

Hopeful Path
You are on the hopeful path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  Forward is The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.

The Land of Unrealized Possibilities
You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is a sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.  The Seaside Path leads forward, towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.

You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), and a TV here.

&gt;[4] ask brother about box
"It's the toy box, just look at it yourself."

&gt;[5] ask brother about rocket
"I don't have a quarter, no, but I think there's a penny under the couch."

&gt;[6] ask brother about quarter
"What are you talking about, dogbreath?"

&gt;[7] ask brother about brother
"It's your brother, just look at it yourself."

The Land of Unlaunched Vessels
You are in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  You stand near the edge of the bay, and there is a sailing ship moored here with thick and aged ropes tied to a bollard.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities, a place you're not sure you want to be.  Forward, Sequel Path leads to The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see a swarthy hippie seaperson here.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.

You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), and a TV here.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

The Land of Unrealized Possibilities
You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is a sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.  The Seaside Path leads forward, towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.

You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), and a TV here.

        <result xml:space="preserve">The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

You sit down for a moment and eat breakfast.  It is delicious but you still don't quite feel satisfied.

Lunch was wonderful.  Your stomach feels like a puzzle, where the final piece has finally been snapped into place.  You now feel as if you could take on the world.

It's a well-maintained picnic table painted in a bright, childish, civic style, depicting a crude sun with huge yellow beams bathing jagged pine trees in their light.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

Some would say that life is like a box of metaphors.  I would not say that.  I would say life is a land of metaphors.  You come to this land perhaps from a hidden door in the back of a piece of furniture, perhaps from a door in a dream.  Either way, you find yourself here.

The Path

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

&gt;[2] eat breakfast
(Breakfast)
You sit down for a moment and eat breakfast.  It is delicious but you still don't quite feel satisfied.

&gt;[3] eat lunch
(Lunch)
Lunch was wonderful.  Your stomach feels like a puzzle, where the final piece has finally been snapped into place.  You now feel as if you could take on the world.

&gt;[4] f

Hopeful Path
You are on the hopeful path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  Forward is The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.

&gt;[5] f

The Land of Unrealized Possibilities
You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.

You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), and a TV here.

&gt;[6] f

Seaside Path
You are on the the seaside path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Forward is The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.

&gt;[7] f

The Land of Unlaunched Vessels
You are in the The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  You stand near the edge of the bay, and there is a sailing ship moored here with thick and aged ropes tied to a bollard.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities, a place you're not sure you want to be.  Forward, Sequel Path leads to The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see an a swarthy hippie seaperson here.

&gt;[8] f

Sequel Path
You are on the the sequel path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  Forward is The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

&gt;[9] f

The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening
You are in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.  There is a launchpad here, on which sits a large, 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red. Sequel Path leads backwards towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels

You can see a launchpad and a Rocket here.

&gt;[10] open hatch
You open the hatch.

&gt;[11] climb ladder
You pull yourself into the rocket.

The Inside of the Parked Rocket
You are within the smooth walls of the rocket.  It is very plain here, out the porthole window you can see the sky, and out the hatch you can see The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see a the cockpit, a big metal unit containing a captain's chair and a control panel here.

&gt;[12] press red button
It's natural to expect blastoff immediately.  Instead, the hatch door whirrs slowly shut, coming to a solid clang.  You have just enough time to realize that you could buckle yourself into the captain's chair and you do.  Just in time, as you feel a tremendous slow and steady thrust of force wrap itself around you as the sky begins to move in the porthole window.  For just one moment you swear you can see The Land of Breakfast and Lunch streak by the window.  Finally, the sky begins to darken, and all sound becomes only a vibration.  The deep, dark void of space is with you.  You absentmindedly unbuckle the webbing securing you to the seat, and you feel free to move about the interior.

The Deep, Dark Void of Space
You are inside the rocket as it cruises very slowly through the deep, dark void of space.  Outside the porthole window is the deep, dark void of space covered over with a curtain of stars.

&gt;[13] press blue button
Whoosh.  You thought maybe the engine engaged again, but something else already did.  It bent space softly around you, and, maybe the rocket moved a little.  Like with a soft whoosh.  It happened in less than a second.  Now, you think you're somewhere else.

Graphene Solar System
You are inside the rocket as it cruises very slowly through the deep, dark void of space.  Outside the porthole window is the deep, dark void of space covered over with a curtain of stars.

You notice something unusual outside the porthole window.

Some would say that life is like a box of metaphors.  I would not say that.  I would say life is a land of metaphors.  You come to this land perhaps from a hidden door in the back of a piece of furniture, perhaps from a door in a dream.  Either way, you find yourself here.

The Inside of the Parked Rocket
You are within the smooth walls of the rocket.  It is very plain here, out the porthole window you can see the sky, and out the hatch you can see The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see a cockpit, a big metal unit containing a captain's chair and a control panel here.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

Mounted on a post next to it is a coin box showing the coin denomination necessary to make it run: 25¢, or one U.S. quarter dollar piece.

There were once two of these rides outside every grocery store in America.  Whether they died out because kids collectively realized they weren't fun, or just liability, you're surprised to see this one here.

The kiddie ride is currently switched off.

You were pretty sure it was going to be awkward to do this, and it sure is.  Your legs are splayed way out and the hobby horse creaks dangerously under your weight.  It holds solid though, and you creak your way back and forward a few times.  You can say you did it.

The Land in Front of the Liquor Store
The Land in Front of the Liquor Store looks mostly abandoned, and you feel a slight sense of disappointment and dread here.  The liquor store is closed, looks like permanently, and there's just a weird kiddie ride here.  There are marks on the sidewalk where some other metal vending machines were, but it looks like they've been carted away.  Only the kiddie ride remains.  It's pretty depressing here, but if you continue to go forward, the Idyllic Path leads to The Land of Puppy Cardiovascular health, which is the H.

You can see a kiddie ride here.

Mounted on a post next to it is a coin box showing the coin denomination necessary to make it run: 25¢, or one U.S. quarter dollar piece.

There were once two of these rides outside every grocery store in America.  Whether they died out because kids collectively realized they weren't fun, or just liability, you're surprised to see this one here.  It's plugged into the liquor store wall.

The kiddie ride is currently switched off.

You distinctly feel the feeling of being so unloved that no one would put a quarter in the slot, not understanding how such a simple thing could make all the difference.  You slide slowly off.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

For just one moment you swear you can see The Land of Breakfast and Lunch streak by the window.  Finally, the sky begins to darken, and all sound becomes only a vibration.  The deep, dark void of space is with you.  You absentmindedly unbuckle the webbing securing you to the seat, and you feel free to move about the interior.

The Deep, Dark Void of Space
You are inside the rocket as it cruises very slowly through the deep, dark void of space.  Outside the porthole window is the deep, dark void of space covered over with a curtain of stars.

A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

You sit down for a moment and eat breakfast.  It is delicious but you still don't quite feel satisfied.

Lunch was wonderful.  Your stomach feels like a puzzle, where the final piece has finally been snapped into place.  You now feel as if you could take on the world.

The seaperson puts both fingers in her mouth and emits an incredibly loud and shrill whistle.  A crewmember pops his head over the edge of the deck and she gives him a little nod.  A few minutes later, he appears at the retaining wall with a large rowboat.

The seaperson hops in, and they row around to the opposite side of the fluyt.  Several minutes later, you see the hippie seaperson doggedly climbing the mast to get to the tennis ball.  It takes her quite a few minutes to get it pulled free from however it's attached to the mast.

Finally, she's rowed back to the retaining wall and she returns to you, panting deeply.  "Here you go," she says wearily, "I hope you find some good use for it."

You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.

Some would say that life is like a box of metaphors.  I would not say that.  I would say life is a land of metaphors.  You come to this land perhaps from a hidden door in the back of a piece of furniture, perhaps from a door in a dream.  Either way, you find yourself here.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
~ a land can contain both ~ by Daniel Talsky
Release 3 / Serial number 200318 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

The Path
You are at the beginning of a path.  It is plain, even homely.  It leads forward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  If you "walk forward" you will follow the path.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

&gt;[2] eat breakfast
(Breakfast)
You sit down for a moment and eat breakfast.  It is delicious but you still don't quite feel satisfied.

&gt;[3] eat lunch
(Lunch)
Lunch was wonderful.  Your stomach feels like a puzzle, where the final piece has finally been snapped into place.  You now feel as if you could take on the world.

&gt;[4] f

Hopeful Path
You are on the hopeful path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  Forward is The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.

&gt;[5] f

The Land of Unrealized Possibilities
You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.

You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), and a TV here.

&gt;[6] f

Seaside Path
You are on the the seaside path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Forward is The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.

&gt;[7] f

The Land of Unlaunched Vessels
You are in the The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  You stand near the edge of the bay, and there is a vessel moored here with thick and aged ropes tied to a bollard.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities, a place you're not sure you want to be.  Forward, Sequel Path leads to The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see a kiddie ride and an a swarthy hippie seaperson here.

The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening
You are in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.  There is a launchpad here, on which sits a large, 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red. Sequel Path leads backwards towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels

You can see a launchpad and a Rocket here.

&gt;[10] open hatch
You open the hatch.

&gt;[11] climb ladder
You pull yourself into the rocket.

The Inside of the Parked Rocket
You are within the smooth walls of the rocket.  It is very plain here, out the porthole window you can see the sky, and out the hatch you can see The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see a the cockpit, a big metal unit containing a captain's chair and a control panel here.

&gt;[12] press red button
It's natural to expect blastoff immediately.  Instead, the hatch door whirrs slowly shut, coming to a solid clang.  You have just enough time to realize that you could buckle yourself into the captain's chair and you do.  Just in time, as you feel a tremendous slow and steady thrust of force wrap itself around you as the sky begins to move in the porthole window.  For just one moment you swear you can see The Land of Breakfast and Lunch streak by the window.  Finally, the sky begins to darken, and all sound becomes only a vibration.  The deep, dark void of space is with you.  You absentmindedly unbuckle the webbing securing you to the seat, and you feel free to move about the interior.

The Deep, Dark Void of Space
You are inside the rocket as it cruises very slowly through the deep, dark void of space.  Outside the porthole window is the deep, dark void of space covered over with a curtain of stars.

&gt;[13] press blue button
Whoosh.  You thought maybe the engine engaged again, but something else already did.  It bent space softly around you, and, maybe the rocket moved a little.  Like with a soft whoosh.  It happened in less than a second.  Now, you think you're somewhere else.

Kamiro Quadrant
You are inside the rocket as it cruises very slowly through the deep, dark void of space.  Outside the porthole window is the deep, dark void of space covered over with a curtain of stars.

You notice something unusual outside the porthole window.

That's it.  Surely you should be able to operate a spacecraft with only those controls?  (You look on the front for a button marked "Fire Laser" or "Warp 7" but those buttons are not on the control panel or anywhere else inside the ship.)

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

It doesn't really seem appropriate to just start eating lunch with a perfectly good breakfast sitting there at the same table.  Besides, you're really more in the mood for breakfast.

For just one moment you swear you can see The Land of Breakfast and Lunch streak by the window.  Finally, the sky begins to darken, and all sound becomes only a vibration.  The deep, dark void of space is with you.  You absentmindedly unbuckle the webbing securing you to the seat, and you feel free to move about the interior.

You startle the simian businessperson and they lose their concentration for one moment.  Their fingers whip forward towards you involuntarily, and you suddenly feel whatever they were holding in the palm of your own hand.  It is a shiny 1964 quarter.

A dark little tune plinks its way out, echoing forth from the little tin box.  It's not "all around the mulberry bush" or any song you recognize, so you don't quite expect it when its last note ends, and the spring-loaded doll within leaps out with surprising agility.  You jump a tiny bit, in spite of yourself.  The devil doll looks pleased.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch (on the painted picnic table)
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing the empty dishes from a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

On the painted picnic table you can see Lunch.

The Land of Unrealized Possibilities
You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is a sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.  The Seaside Path leads forward, towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

&gt;[2] eat breakfast
(Breakfast)
You sit down for a moment and eat breakfast.  It is delicious but you still don't quite feel satisfied.

&gt;[3] eat lunch
(Lunch)
Lunch was wonderful.  Your stomach feels like a puzzle, where the final piece has finally been snapped into place.  You now feel as if you could take on the world.

Hopeful Path
You are on the hopeful path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  Forward is The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.

The Land of Unrealized Possibilities
You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is a sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.  The Seaside Path leads forward, towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.

You can see a toy box (in which are a wooden block, a skinny naked plastic doll, a lite-brite (empty), a coloring book, a small heart shaped locket (closed), and a small hobby horse), a couch (on which is your brother), and a TV here.

Forward, Sequel Path leads to The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening
You are in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.  There is a launchpad here, on which sits a large, 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red. The Sequel Path leads backwards towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  Ahead of you, The Anticlimactic Path probably leads somewhere really amazing.

You can see a launchpad and a rocket here.

&gt;[10] open hatch
You open the hatch.

&gt;[11] climb ladder
You pull yourself into the rocket.

The Inside of the Parked Rocket
You are within the smooth walls of the rocket.  It is very plain here, out the porthole window you can see the sky, and out the hatch you can see The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see a cockpit, a big metal unit containing a captain's chair and a control panel here.

&gt;[12] press red button
It's natural to expect blastoff immediately.  Instead, the hatch door whirrs slowly shut, coming to a solid clang.  You have just enough time to realize that you could buckle yourself into the captain's chair and you do.  Just in time, as you feel a tremendous slow and steady thrust of force wrap itself around you as the sky begins to move in the porthole window.  For just one moment you swear you can see The Land of Breakfast and Lunch streak by the window.  Finally, the sky begins to darken, and all sound becomes only a vibration.  The deep, dark void of space is with you.  You absentmindedly unbuckle the webbing securing you to the seat, and you feel free to move about the interior.

The Deep, Dark Void of Space
You are inside the rocket as it cruises very slowly through the deep, dark void of space.  Outside the porthole window is the deep, dark void of space covered over with a curtain of stars.

&gt;[13] press blue button
Whoosh.  You thought maybe the engine engaged again, but something else already did.  It bent space softly around you, and, maybe the rocket moved a little.  Like with a soft whoosh.  It happened in less than a second.  Now, you think you're somewhere else.

Elbow Nebula
You are inside the rocket as it cruises very slowly through the deep, dark void of space.  Outside the porthole window is the deep, dark void of space covered over with a curtain of stars.

You notice something unusual outside the porthole window.

You are inside the rocket as it cruises very slowly through the deep, dark void of space.  Outside the porthole window is the deep, dark void of space covered over with a curtain of stars.

You notice something unusual outside the porthole window.

        <result xml:space="preserve">You grasp the little wooden ball and begin to turn the crank as you hold the jack-in-the-box steady.  A dark little tune plinks its way out, echoing forth from the little tin box.  It's not "all around the mulberry bush" or any song you recognize, so you don't quite expect it when its last note ends, and the spring-loaded doll within leaps out with surprising agility.  You jump a tiny bit, in spite of yourself.  The devil doll looks pleased.

The simian businessperson's eyes whip suddenly to the face of the devil doll.  Its eyes widen and turn shockingly pale blue in a clearly recognizable look of total terror.  Their fingers whip forward towards you involuntarily, and you suddenly feel whatever they were holding in the palm of your own hand.  It is a shiny 1964 quarter.  The businessperson looks briefly dismayed but merely pulls something else out of its pocket.

You are in The Land of Once Launched Vessels.  There is a launchpad here, on which sits a large, 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red. The The Spiritual Sequel Path leads backwards towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  Ahead of you, The Anticlimactic Path probably leads somewhere really amazing.

The Land in Front of the Liquor Store
The Land in Front of the Liquor Store looks mostly abandoned, and you feel a slight sense of disappointment and dread here.  The liquor store is closed, looks like permanently, and there's just a weird kiddie ride here.  There are marks on the sidewalk where some other metal vending machines were, but it looks like they've been carted away.  Only the kiddie ride remains.  It's pretty depressing here, but if you continue to go forward, the Idyllic Path leads to The Land of Puppy Cardiovascular health, which is the final land.

The song is "In my merry Oldsmobile" and the dance of the humvee is drunken yet tame as it rolls and lists in a pattern potentially thrilling to a 3-year old but usually not really.  If you want to, you can ride the humvee now.

At first you find it boring, but you quickly get in the spirit, facetiously adjusting your imaginary cowboy hat and making a quick lasso motion with your wrist to show the yellow humvee you're in full control, despite its raucous bucking.

If this was what you were trying to do, you pretty much won the game, but c'mon, you entered this fictional world with all its richness and descriptions of antipasto and space locations and all you wanted to do is solve its one puzzle?  It's a mood piece, man!  You're just supposed to be relaxed and soak up the sweet, sweet ambience.  That said, none of my beta testers actually got the puzzle on their own.  I didn't think it was that hard since if you trigger the jack-in-the-box in the room you find it in, it freaks your brother out, so I felt like that was a big clue, but I do have a lot of worthless items / red herrings.  What was I talking about?  I dunno, good job though.  I personally suck at puzzles in games so I doubt I would have been able to figure it out myself.

Ok.  I'll admit it.  There might be one even harder puzzle.

You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.

You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), a TV, and a kiddie ride here.

Instead, you're taking the time to explore something I made and I really appreciate it.  I had fun making this, but most of the fun was imagining you doing what you're doing right now.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

There are a couple of little tricky things you can accomplish, but there's really no point other than to look at everything and smell everything and laugh at my dumb little jokes.  Sometimes people don't notice the toy box in The Land of Unrealized Possiblities.  Sometimes people don't realize you can "open hatch" and "enter rocket" when you're near the 1950"s rocket.  Yes, there's one little puzzle and it involves the jack-in-the-box, but don't get too concerned about it.  If you need any other help you can just email me at danieltalsky@gmail.com.  I'm happy to help.

The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening
You are in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.  There is a launchpad here, on which sits a large, 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red. Sequel Path leads backwards towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels

You can see a launchpad and a Rocket here.

&gt;[8] x launchpad
You look at the launchpad very closely indeed, and to be completely honest, it looks about how you'd expect.  You think for a moment that there might be something slightly special about it but then, upon looking just a little closer, you see that there isn't.

&gt;[9] x rocket
On the launchpad sits a 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red.  Close your eyes and imagine the idea of a cartoon rocket (ok, now open them again) and that's what you've got here.  It's got a bubble of a porthole, curvy fins, and an incredibly phallic body, coming to a point with an extra couple of spheres on the tip of the nose cone.  There is a small, retractable ladder that leads to the hatch.

&gt;[10] x porthole
The porthole is the single window of the rocket, and it bubbles out from the body of the rocket so when you're inside, you can see a wider vista.  It has a pleasant curve to it.

&gt;[11] x bubble
It's not literally a bubble, it's just a bubble-like window attached to the rocket.

&gt;[12] x fins
There are three fins, evenly spaced around the rocket.  At first it looks like the rocket rests on them, but really they're just inches above the launchpad.  They have a pleasing curve to them and come almost to a sharp point.

&gt;[13] x hatch
The hatch is a small door in the rocket.  It has a hinge on the side, and a handle that looks like the locking handle on the door of a 1950's refrigerator.

&gt;[14] x ladder
You look at the retractable ladder very closely indeed, and to be completely honest, it looks about how you'd expect.  You think for a moment that there might be something slightly special about it but then, upon looking just a little closer, you see that there isn't.

&gt;[15] x cone
The nose cone follows the natural curve of the body of the rocket, coming to a point, and sprouting a single pole antenna with little spheres on it.

&gt;[16] x spheres
The middle sphere is the largest, the top sphere is the smallest, and the bottom sphere is halfway between the size of the two other spheres.  It looks pretty cool in a 1950's sort of way.

&gt;[17] retract ladder
The ladder retracts automatically when the rocket is getting ready to launch.

&gt;[18] climb ladder
Little is to be achieved by that.

&gt;[19] enter rocket
The hatch is closed.

&gt;[20] open hatch
You open the hatch.

&gt;[21] enter rocket
You pull yourself into the rocket.

The Inside of the Parked Rocket
You are within the smooth walls of the rocket.  It is very plain here, out the portal you can see  The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.

You can see a shiny red button here.
