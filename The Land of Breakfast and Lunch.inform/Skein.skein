The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), a TV, and a kiddie ride here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[4] f&#x000A;&#x000A;Seaside Path&#x000A;You are on the the seaside path.

There is a launchpad here, on which sits a large, 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red.

You think for a moment that there might be something slightly special about it but then, upon looking just a little closer, you see that there isn't.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[9] x rocket&#x000A;On the launchpad sits a 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red.  Close your eyes and imagine the idea of a cartoon rocket (ok, now open them again) and that's what you've got here.  It's got a bubble of a porthole, curvy fins, and an incredibly phallic body, coming to a point with an extra couple of spheres on the tip of the nose cone.  There is a small, retractable ladder that leads to the hatch.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] x porthole&#x000A;The porthole is the single window of the rocket, and it bubbles out from the body of the rocket so when you're inside, you can see a wider vista.  It has a pleasant curve to it.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] x bubble&#x000A;It's not literally a bubble, it's just a bubble-like window attached to the rocket.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] x fins&#x000A;There are three fins, evenly spaced around the rocket.  At first it looks like the rocket rests on them, but really they're just inches above the launchpad.  They have a pleasing curve to them and come almost to a sharp point.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] x hatch&#x000A;The hatch is a small door in the rocket.  It has a hinge on the side, and a handle that looks like the locking handle on the door of a 1950's refrigerator.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] x ladder&#x000A;You look at the retractable ladder very closely indeed, and to be completely honest, it looks about how you'd expect.  You think for a moment that there might be something slightly special about it but then, upon looking just a little closer, you see that there isn't.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[15] x cone&#x000A;The nose cone follows the natural curve of the body of the rocket, coming to a point, and sprouting a single pole antenna with little spheres on it.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[16] x spheres&#x000A;The middle sphere is the largest, the top sphere is the smallest, and the bottom sphere is halfway between the size of the two other spheres.  It looks pretty cool in a 1950's sort of way.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[17] retract ladder&#x000A;The ladder retracts automatically when the rocket is getting ready to launch.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[18] climb ladder&#x000A;Little is to be achieved by that.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[19] enter rocket&#x000A;The hatch is closed.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[20] open hatch&#x000A;You open the hatch.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[21] enter rocket&#x000A;You pull yourself into the rocket.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Inside of the Parked Rocket&#x000A;You are within the smooth walls of the rocket.

    <result xml:space="preserve">The Land of Breakfast and Lunch&#x000A;The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[2] f&#x000A;&#x000A;Hopeful Path&#x000A;You are on the hopeful path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  Forward is The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[3] f&#x000A;&#x000A;The Land of Unrealized Possibilities&#x000A;You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.

There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), a TV, and a kiddie ride here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[4] f&#x000A;&#x000A;Seaside Path&#x000A;You are on the the seaside path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Forward is The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[5] f&#x000A;&#x000A;The Land of Unlaunched Vessels&#x000A;You are in the The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  You stand near the edge of the bay, and there is a vessel moored here with thick and aged ropes tied to a bollard.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities, a place you're not sure you want to be.  Forward, Sequel Path leads to The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see an a swarthy hippie seaperson here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[6] f&#x000A;&#x000A;Sequel Path&#x000A;You are on the the sequel path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Unlaunched Vessels.  Forward is The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[7] f&#x000A;&#x000A;The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening&#x000A;You are in The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.  There is a launchpad here, on which sits a large, 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red. Sequel Path leads backwards towards The Land of Unlaunched Vessels&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a launchpad and a Rocket here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] x launchpad&#x000A;You look at the launchpad very closely indeed, and to be completely honest, it looks about how you'd expect.  You think for a moment that there might be something slightly special about it but then, upon looking just a little closer, you see that there isn't.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[9] x rocket&#x000A;On the launchpad sits a 1950's era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red.  Close your eyes and imagine the idea of a cartoon rocket (ok, now open them again) and that's what you've got here.  It's got a bubble of a porthole, curvy fins, and an incredibly phallic body, coming to a point with an extra couple of spheres on the tip of the nose cone.  There is a small, retractable ladder that leads to the hatch.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] x porthole&#x000A;The porthole is the single window of the rocket, and it bubbles out from the body of the rocket so when you're inside, you can see a wider vista.  It has a pleasant curve to it.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] x bubble&#x000A;It's not literally a bubble, it's just a bubble-like window attached to the rocket.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] x fins&#x000A;There are three fins, evenly spaced around the rocket.  At first it looks like the rocket rests on them, but really they're just inches above the launchpad.  They have a pleasing curve to them and come almost to a sharp point.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] x hatch&#x000A;The hatch is a small door in the rocket.  It has a hinge on the side, and a handle that looks like the locking handle on the door of a 1950's refrigerator.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] x ladder&#x000A;You look at the retractable ladder very closely indeed, and to be completely honest, it looks about how you'd expect.  You think for a moment that there might be something slightly special about it but then, upon looking just a little closer, you see that there isn't.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[15] x cone&#x000A;The nose cone follows the natural curve of the body of the rocket, coming to a point, and sprouting a single pole antenna with little spheres on it.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[16] x spheres&#x000A;The middle sphere is the largest, the top sphere is the smallest, and the bottom sphere is halfway between the size of the two other spheres.  It looks pretty cool in a 1950's sort of way.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[17] retract ladder&#x000A;The ladder retracts automatically when the rocket is getting ready to launch.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[18] climb ladder&#x000A;Little is to be achieved by that.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[19] enter rocket&#x000A;The hatch is closed.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[20] open hatch&#x000A;You open the hatch.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[21] enter rocket&#x000A;You pull yourself into the rocket.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Inside of the Parked Rocket&#x000A;You are within the smooth walls of the rocket.  It is very plain here, out the portal you can see  The Land of Unlaunched Vessels II: The Launchening.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a shiny red button here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
