Some would say that life is like a box of metaphors.  I would not say that.  I would say life is a land of metaphors.  You come to this land perhaps from a hidden door in the back of a piece of furniture, perhaps from a door in a dream.  Either way, you find yourself here.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
~ a land can contain both ~ by Daniel Talsky
Release 1 / Serial number 200224 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Path
You are at the beginning of a path.  It is plain, even homely.  It leads forward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  If you "walk forward" you will follow the path.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

Hopeful Path
You are on the hopeful path.  Backwards from here is The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  Forward is The Land of Unrealized Possiblities.

The Land of Unrealized Possiblities
You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.

You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), and a TV here.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch
The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.

        <result xml:space="preserve">It looks like a well-made potato salad, filled with richness and zing.  You can see flecks of red onion and a light dusting of paprika.  In case you don't know what a ramekin is, it's a small straight-walled bowl with scalloped outside walls. Perfect for an attractive presentation of a small potato salad serving.

The Land of Unrealized Possiblities
You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.

You can see a toy box (closed), a couch (on which is your brother), and a TV here.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.

You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you "walk forward" or just "forward" or even just "f" you will be walking towards it.

You can see a painted picnic table (on which are Breakfast and Lunch) here.
