When play begins:
	say "Some would say that life is like a box of metaphors.  I would not say that.  I would say life is a land of metaphors.  You come to this land perhaps from a hidden door in the back of a piece of furniture, perhaps from a door in a dream.  Either way, you find yourself here."

Check going south:
	If the player is in The Path:
		say "This really is as far back as the path goes.  Further behind you there's just a bunch of scrub brush as far as the eye can see.  It's really not your kind of thing."

[The Land of Breakfast and Lunch]
TLoBL is a room. "The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you 'walk forward' or just 'forward' or even just 'f' you will be walking towards it.".  TLoBL is north of The Path.
The printed name of TLoBL is "The Land of Breakfast and Lunch"

Instead of eating the breakfast:
	say "You sit down for a moment and eat breakfast.  It is delicious but you still don't quite feel satisfied.";
	now the description of TLoBL is "The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.

Instead of eating or taking or tasting a part-of-a-complete-breakfast, say "Breakfast is kind of an all-or-nothing affair.  One really needs to sit down and tuck into it, rather than simply nibbling at one thing or another and leaving the rest of it to repel and disgust another traveller.".

The description of the bowl is "It looks like a bowl filled with the famous cereal known as Lieutenant Chomp.  You grew up seeing the commercials and can almost see the picture of the Lieutenant on the box in your mind's eye.

Instead of smelling the bowl of Lieutenant Chomp, say "It smells like sugar."

The description is "The soft-boiled egg is a prim and underappreciated breakfast item.  Sure, it's a lot of work to get to all the egg, but it's a very delicate experience.

Instead of eating the lunch:
	if the breakfast is on the table:
		say "It doesn't really seem appropriate to just start eating lunch with a perfectly good breakfast sitting there at the same table.  Besides, you're really more in the mood for breakfast." instead;
	else:
		say "Lunch was wonderful.  Your stomach feels like a puzzle, where the final piece has finally been snapped into place.  You now feel as if you could take on the world.";
		now the description of TLoBL is "The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing the empty dishes from a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and the dishes of a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.

The description of the grilled cheese sandwich is "It's a grilled cheese sandwich in the classic sense, in that there's nothing in it but cheese.

The bread is toasted to a perfect golden brown and glistens with its thin layer of butter."

The bowl of tomato soup is a part-of-a-complete-lunch on the table.  Understand "pepper" as the soup.  The description of the bowl of tomato soup is "Warm, creamy, and comforting, and about two thirds the way to filling a fiestaware bowl.  There is a bit of coarsely cracked pepper at the top."

	otherwise if the player is in TLOUV:
		say "[line break]'AAAAAAAGH,' the seaperson screams, leaping fully into the air, a wide, scratchy bellow.  'Goddamnit.  Get that creepy thing away from me,' she requests sincerely, 'What the hell is that, a little devil-in-a-box?  What's wrong with you?'.";

Understand "sit on [the kiddie ride]" as riding.
Instead of riding the kiddie ride:
	If the kiddie ride is switched on:
		say "You climb up on the molded fiberglass seat of the humvee like a pro and right yourself against its tame rollicking.  At first you find it boring, but you quickly get in the spirit, facetiously adjusting your imaginary cowboy hat and making a quick lasso motion with your wrist to show the yellow humvee you're in full control, despite its raucous bucking.[paragraph break]If this was what you were trying to do, you pretty much won the game.  If you still have more to do, go ahead.";
		now the kiddie ride is switched off;
	otherwise:
		say "You climb up on the molded fiberglass seat of the humvee but it feels cold, joyless, and dead underneath you.  You distinctly feel the feeling of being so unloved that no one would put a quarter in the slot, not understanding how such a simple thing could make all the difference.  You slide slowly off.".
