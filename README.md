# The Land of Breakfast and Lunch

### A diorama of made-up memories.

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is an aimless and detailed text adventure written in Inform 7.

It was my first game in Inform 7 and a learning project to see if I could get past the beginner level in Inform 7.  

At the 2019 Spring thing it won the audience awards:

 - Best Jokes
 - Most Poetic Jokes
 - Best Parser Game

## Game Description

The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is like a walk through a half-remembered childhood place that mixes up vaguely pleasant memories with half-remembered stories read long ago.

It's a detailed world where every detail can be looked at, smelled, or talked to. Meet a swarthy pirate seaperson and go for a ride in a 1950's rocketship.
