The kiddie ride is a switched off device.  It is fixed in place.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Off to the side a little ways is a mechanical kiddie ride.  It's a big (to a child) yellow humvee with cartoon human eyes where the headlights should be.  It's anchored to a diamond plate platform and looks to have stopped mid-tilt.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]Mounted on a post next to it is a coin box showing the coin denomination necessary to make it run: 25¢, or one U.S. quarter dollar piece.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]There were once two of these rides outside every grocery store in America.  Whether they died out because kids collectively realized they weren't fun, or just liability, you're surprised to see this one here.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Understand &quot;<span class="quote">car/humvee</span>&quot; as the kiddie ride.</p><p class="indent0">Check examining the ride:</p><p class="indent1">if the ride is switched on, say &quot;<span class="quote">The kiddie ride has snapped to life, and the humvee is mechanically bucking like a very lazy bronco.</span>&quot; instead.</p><p class="indent0">The human eyes are a part of the kiddie ride. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">On the yellow humvee attached to the kiddie ride are a fiberglass molded set of human-looking eyes.  They're meant to look excited and friendly, but they're straight-up creepy.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[coin box]</span></p><p class="indent0">The coin box is a part of the kiddie ride.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The coin box is a sturdy steel box with a coin slot in one end (25¢) and a coin return on the other.  Next to the coin box is a small, cylindrical coin-release button.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The coin slot is a part of the coin box.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a chrome slot to put a coin in.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The coin return tray is a part of the coin box.  It is a container.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The coin return tray is a shallow metal tray designed to let a coin of any size strike the bottom, convulse in a spasm of physics and metallurgy, and safely come to a rest, waiting for a person to collect it.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The coin release button is a part of the coin box.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The coin release button is a small chrome cylinder that can be depressed all the way down into the coin box.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of pushing the coin release button:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">It smoothly depresses all the way down into the coin box.  If there were a coin stuck in the mechanism, this action would theoretically release it into the coin release tray.

The song is 'In my merry Oldsmobile' and the dance of the humvee is drunken yet tame as it rolls and lists in a pattern potentially thrilling to a 3-year old but usually not really.  If you want to, you can ride the humvee now.</span>&quot; instead;</p><p class="indent1">else:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">It won't fit.

At first you find it boring, but you quickly get in the spirit, facetiously adjusting your imaginary cowboy hat and making a quick lasso motion with your wrist to show the yellow humvee you're in full control, despite its raucous bucking.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]If this was what you were trying to do, you pretty much won the game.  If you still have more to do, go ahead.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent2">now the kiddie ride is switched off;</p><p class="indent1">otherwise:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">You climb up on the molded fiberglass seat of the humvee but it feels cold, joyless, and dead underneath you.  You distinctly feel the feeling of being so unloved that no one would put a quarter in the slot, not understanding how such a simple thing could make all the difference.  You slide slowly off.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">Test ride with &quot;<span class="quote">f / f / f / x ride / press coin release button / look under couch / get penny / put penny in slot</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[The Hippie Seaperson]</span></p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="indent0">The swarthy hippie seaperson is a woman in the TLOUV.
