Backwards from here is The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  Forward is The Land of Unrealized Possiblities.</span>&quot;  The Hopeful Path is north of TLoBL.</p><p class="indent0">TLoUP is a room. &quot;<span class="quote">You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.</span>&quot;   TLoUP is north of the hopeful path.</p><p class="indent0">The printed name of TLoUP is &quot;<span class="quote">The Land of Unrealized Possiblities</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">There is a toy box in TLoUP.

It has a hinged lid on top.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">There is a wooden block in the toy box.  The description of the wooden block is &quot;<span class="quote">It is a simple block made out of wood.  It is unpainted.  It's the kind of thing you would find at a Montessouri school, usually in the company of many of its compatriots.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">There is a small heart shaped locket in the toy box.  It is an openable closed container.  The description of the locket is &quot;<span class="quote">It is a small pewter locket.  It looks a bit old fashioned.  It has a small clasp on the side and looks like you could easily open it.</span>&quot;  Understand &quot;<span class="quote">clasp</span>&quot; as the locket.</p><p class="indent0">There is a faded picture of a child who looks a lot like you in the locket.    The description of the picture is &quot;<span class="quote">You don't remember ever seeing any picture of you like this photo, but this one looks almost exactly other pictures of you at about three.  There is a smile that's a mix of sadness and joy on the child's face.  When you look at it, you can almost feel the feeling.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">There is a small hobby horse in the toy box.   The description of the horse is &quot;<span class="quote">It is a small, wooden hobby horse.  It's very sturdily built, but made to entertain a three-year old.

It is a supporter. It is fixed in place. The description of the couch is &quot;<span class="quote">This is the blue corduroy couch of your youth.  You have rolled over on it many times and sat up to read it's wrinkled poem on your arm.  Why would anyone get a corduroy couch?</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">There is a small, grimy penny under the couch.</p><p class="indent0">There is a TV in TLOUP. It is fixed in place.  The description of the TV is &quot;<span class="quote">An early 35' flatscreen.  Bulky, black, and plastic.  It lived in your den for way too long, just because no one wanted to lift it.
