Backwards from here is The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  Forward is The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.</span>&quot;  The Hopeful Path is north of TLoBL.</p><p class="indent0">TLoUP is a room. &quot;<span class="quote">You are in the Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads backward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.</span>&quot;   TLoUP is north of the hopeful path.</p><p class="indent0">The printed name of TLoUP is &quot;<span class="quote">The Land of Unrealized Possibilities</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">There is a toy box in TLoUP.  It is an openable closed container.  It is fixed in place.  The description of the toy box is &quot;<span class="quote">It is a large simple wooden toy box stained with a nice hand-painted varnish.  It has a hinged lid on top.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Understand &quot;<span class="quote">lid</span>&quot; as the toy box.</p><p class="indent0">There is a wooden block in the toy box.  The description of the wooden block is &quot;<span class="quote">It is a simple block made out of wood.  It is unpainted.  It's the kind of thing you would find at a Montessouri school, usually in the company of many of its compatriots.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">There is a small heart shaped locket in the toy box.  It is an openable closed container.  It is wearable.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It is a small pewter locket.  It looks a bit old fashioned.  It has a small clasp on the side and looks like you could easily open it.</span>&quot;  Understand &quot;<span class="quote">clasp</span>&quot; as the locket.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of inserting something (called the item) into the locket:</p><p class="indent1">if the item is not the picture:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">The locket is quite small.</span>&quot; instead;</p><p class="indent1">otherwise:</p><p class="indent2">continue the action.</p><p class="indent0">There is a faded picture of a child who looks a lot like you in the locket.    The description of the picture is &quot;<span class="quote">You don't remember ever seeing any picture of you like this photo, but this one looks almost exactly other pictures of you at about three.  There is a smile that's a mix of sadness and joy on the child's face.  When you look at it, you can almost feel the feeling.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Understand &quot;<span class="quote">photo/photograph/smile</span>&quot; as the picture.</p><p class="indent0">There is a small hobby horse in the toy box.   The description of the horse is &quot;<span class="quote">It is a small, wooden hobby horse.  It's very sturdily built, but made to entertain a three-year old.  It has yarn for a mane.</span>&quot;  Understand &quot;<span class="quote">yarn</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">mane</span>&quot; as the horse.</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[Your Brother]</span></p><p class="indent0">There is a couch in TLoUP.  It is a supporter. It is fixed in place. The description of the couch is &quot;<span class="quote">This is the blue corduroy couch of your youth.  You have rolled over on it many times and sat up to read it's wrinkled poem on your arm.  Why would anyone get a corduroy couch?</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">There is a small, grimy penny under the couch.  The description of the penny is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a single penny, so grimy you can't read the date.  It looks older than 1982, which means it's made of solid copper, but coated in rust and grime.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">There is a small, grimy penny. The penny can be found or lost. The penny is lost.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of looking under the couch when the penny is lost:</p><p class="indent1">move the penny to TLoUP;</p><p class="indent1">now the penny is found;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">There's nothing under there except a small, grimy penny.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"><span class="heading">Table 1 - TV Shows</span></p><table><tr><td><span class="columnhead">channel</span></td><td><span class="columnhead">show</span></td></tr>
