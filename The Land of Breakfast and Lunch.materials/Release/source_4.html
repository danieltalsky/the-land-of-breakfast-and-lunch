Close your eyes and imagine the idea of a cartoon rocket (ok, now open them again) and that's what you've got here.  It's got a bubble of a porthole, curvy fins, and an incredibly phallic body, coming to a point with an extra couple of spheres on the tip of the nose cone.  There is a small, retractable ladder that leads to the hatch.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Before entering the rocket:</p><p class="indent1">if the hatch is closed:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">The hatch is closed.</span>&quot; instead.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of entering the rocket:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">You pull yourself into the rocket.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">now the player is in parked-rocket-innards.</p><p class="indent0">The porthole is a part of the rocket.

It has a pleasant curve to it.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The bubble is a part of the rocket.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It's not literally a bubble, it's just a bubble-like window attached to the rocket.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The body is a part of the rocket.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It is a smooth, curved shape like an old-timey cigar.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The fins are a part of the rocket.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">There are three fins, evenly spaced around the rocket.  At first it looks like the rocket rests on them, but really they're just inches above the launchpad.  They have a pleasing curve to them and come almost to a sharp point.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The hatch is a part of the rocket.   The hatch can be openable. The hatch can be open. The hatch is openable and closed.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The hatch is a small door in the rocket.

The ladder is a supporter.  &quot;<span class="quote">The ladder is made out of steel and has seven rungs, and is attached to the rocket.  Climbing it leads you to the hatch.  When the hatch is open, it allows you to climb right inside.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The rungs are a part of the ladder.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Sturdy, steel rungs.

The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The nose cone follows the natural curve of the body of the rocket, coming to a point, and sprouting a single pole antenna with little spheres on it.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The antenna is a part of the nose cone. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The antenna sprouts directly up from the nose cone.  It is adorned with three spheres.  They must help with radio reception or something.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The spheres are a part of the antenna.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The middle sphere is the largest, the top sphere is the smallest, and the bottom sphere is halfway between the size of the two other spheres.
