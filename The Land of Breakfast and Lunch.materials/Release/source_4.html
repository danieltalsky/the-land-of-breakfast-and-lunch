The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The launchpad appears to be just a featureless steel box set into the ground.  Only a few inches of it protrude up to support the rocket.  It has a mirrory shine, as if the rocket had never been launched.</span>&quot;  </p><p class="indent0">Understand &quot;<span class="quote">pad</span>&quot; as the launchpad.</p><p class="indent0">The rocket is in TLOUV2. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">On the launchpad sits a 1950[</span><span class="substitution">apostrophe</span><span class="quote">]s era rocket in galaxy white and candy-apple red.  Close your eyes and imagine the idea of a cartoon rocket (ok, now open them again) and that's what you've got here.  It's got a bubble of a porthole, curvy fins, and an incredibly phallic body, coming to a point with an extra couple of spheres on the tip of the nose cone.  There is a small, retractable ladder that leads to the hatch.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Before entering the rocket:</p><p class="indent1">if the hatch is closed:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">The hatch is closed.</span>&quot; instead.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of entering the rocket:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">You pull yourself into the rocket.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">now the player is in parked-rocket-innards.</p><p class="indent0">The porthole is a part of the rocket.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The porthole is the single window of the rocket, and it bubbles out from the body of the rocket so when you're inside, you can see a wider vista.  It has a pleasant curve to it.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of searching the porthole, say &quot;<span class="quote">From outside the rocket, the rounded curve of the porthole looks almost metallic.  You assume it's transparent from the inside.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The nose cone is a part of the rocket.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The nose cone follows the natural curve of the body of the rocket, coming to a point, and sprouting a single pole antenna with little spheres on it.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The antenna is a part of the nose cone. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The antenna sprouts directly up from the nose cone.  It is adorned with three spheres.  They must help with radio reception or something.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The spheres are a part of the antenna.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The middle sphere is the largest, the top sphere is the smallest, and the bottom sphere is halfway between the size of the two other spheres.  It looks pretty cool in a 1950[</span><span class="substitution">apostrophe</span><span class="quote">]s sort of way.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The bubble is a part of the rocket.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It's not literally a bubble, it's just a bubble-like window attached to the rocket.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The body is a part of the rocket.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It is a smooth, curved shape like a cigar.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The fins are a part of the rocket.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">There are two fins opposite each other, evenly spaced around the rocket.  At first it looks like the rocket rests on them, but really they're just inches above the launchpad.  They each have a pleasing curve to them and terminate in what looks like a jet engine.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The jet engines are a part of the rocket.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">You're not sure if they could lift this massive thing into space, but it seems possible.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The hatch is a part of the rocket.   The hatch can be openable. The hatch can be open. The hatch is openable and closed.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The hatch is a small door in the rocket.  It has a hinge on the side, and a handle that looks like the locking handle on the door of a 1950[</span><span class="substitution">apostrophe</span><span class="quote">]s refrigerator.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">Understand &quot;<span class="quote">handle</span>&quot; as the hatch.</p><p class="indent0">The hinge is a part of the hatch.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of searching the hatch:</p><p class="indent1">if the hatch is open:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">You can tell there's not much inside the rocket but smooth walls and some sort of cockpit.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">else:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">The hatch is closed, and you're not able to see through it.  It looks like you could open it, however.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The retractable ladder is a part of the rocket.  The ladder is a supporter.  &quot;<span class="quote">The ladder is made out of steel and has seven rungs, and is attached to the rocket.  Climbing it leads you to the hatch.  When the hatch is open, it allows you to climb right inside.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The rungs are a part of the ladder.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Sturdy, steel rungs.  There are seven of them.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Retracting is an action applying to one visible thing.</p><p class="indent0">Understand &quot;<span class="quote">retract [</span><span class="substitution">something</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot; as retracting.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of retracting a thing:</p><p class="indent1">if the noun is the ladder:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">The ladder retracts automatically when the rocket is getting ready to launch.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">otherwise:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">That's not retractable.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">Check going up:</p><p class="indent1">if the location is TLOUV2:</p><p class="indent2">try entering the rocket instead.</p><p class="indent0">Understand &quot;<span class="quote">climb [</span><span class="substitution">the ladder</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot; as entering.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of entering the ladder:</p><p class="indent1">try entering the rocket. </p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[The Inside of the Parked Rocket]</span></p><p class="indent0">parked-rocket-innards is a room.

The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The walls are smooth and cool and curved.

It is scenery.

It doesn't seem possible to close it from inside the rocket.  There's probably some control inside the rocket that closes it.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The landed porthole window is scenery in parked-rocket-innards.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The porthole window, at the moment, allows you a good view of the featureless sky above [</span><span class="substitution">printed name of TLOUV2</span><span class="quote">].</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The cockpit is in parked-rocket-innards.  It is fixed in place.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The cockpit, containing the captain[</span><span class="substitution">apostrophe</span><span class="quote">]s chair and the control panel is firmly mounted to the inner wall of the rocket across from the porthole.  The captain's chair is angled so that you can sit in it when the rocket is vertical or horizontal.</span>&quot;  The printed name is &quot;<span class="quote">cockpit, a big metal unit containing a captain[</span><span class="substitution">apostrophe</span><span class="quote">]s chair and a control panel</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The captain's chair is a part of the cockpit.  It is a supporter.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The captain's chair is rightfully named.  It looks fit for a captain.  It's leather-clad, and the same galaxy white and candy-apple red as the exterior of the ship.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of entering the chair:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">You settle into the captain's chair, and really feel Captain-ey immediately.  You practice buckling yourself into the protective webbing, and unbuckling it.  You get up eventually.  Now, when you are about to launch or land you will know what to do.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[The Control Panel]</span></p><p class="indent0">The control panel is a part of the cockpit.  The description of the control panel is &quot;<span class="quote">The control panel is an extremely austere, some might even say naive set of controls.  There is a large, shiny, red button labeled 'Launch', a smaller black button that[</span><span class="substitution">apostrophe</span><span class="quote">]s labeled 'Return', and then off to your right, a medium-sized bright blue button labeled 'Forward'.  Finally, along the top is a small LED readout display that says '[</span><span class="substitution">description of readout-location-name </span><span class="quote">]'.[</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]That's it.

The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The LED readout display is a small, crude screen made of LED lights that looks like it could display about 50 letters in a pinch.

Just in time, as you feel a tremendous slow and steady thrust of force wrap itself around you as the sky begins to move in the porthole window.
