It is plain, even homely.  It leads forward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  If you 'walk forward' you will follow the path.</span>&quot;  The printed name of the path is &quot;<span class="quote">The Path</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Southmostpath is in The Path.  It is scenery.  The description of southmostpath is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a scrubby little path that just kind of tapers off behind you and leads forward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  If you 'walk forward' you'll be following it.</span>&quot; Understand &quot;<span class="quote">path</span>&quot; as southmostpath.</p><p class="indent0">Scrub brush is in The Path.  It is scenery. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Clusters of scrubby, wild, low shrubbery.  It's the kind of plant that grows where very little else wants to grow.  Like here, at the terminus of this plain path, which is less interesting than the places it leads.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Check going south:</p><p class="indent1">If the player is in The Path:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">This really is as far back as the path goes.  Further behind you there's just a bunch of scrub brush as far as the eye can see.

It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads backwards, and the path continues forward, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you 'walk forward' or just 'forward' or even just 'f' you will be walking towards it.</span>&quot;.

The clearing is scenery.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The clearing is a small picnic area, intentionally cleared and maintained to allow a person or family to stop by the side of the path and dine.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">A painted picnic table is in TLoBL. The table is a supporter. The table is enterable.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a well-maintained picnic table painted in a bright, childish, civic style, depicting a crude sun with huge yellow beams bathing jagged pine trees in their light.</span>&quot;.  </p><p class="indent0">Understand &quot;<span class="quote">table/sun/beams/trees</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">pine trees</span>&quot; as the painted picnic table.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of looking under the table, say &quot;<span class="quote">The grass underneath is getting a bit brown.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Grass is scenery in TLoBL.  The description of the grass is &quot;<span class="quote">It's grassy.

It is edible.  The table can be meals-eaten or meals-uneaten.  The table is meals-uneaten.  The description of breakfast is &quot;<span class="quote">Breakfast consists of a halved grapefruit with the membranes cut for easier eating, a soft-boiled egg in a specially designed holder, and a bowl of Lieutenant Chomp with a small pitcher of milk next to it.</span>&quot;. </p><p class="indent0">Instead of taking the breakfast: say &quot;<span class="quote">The breakfast has several items and is a little unwieldy.  You can take a moment and eat the breakfast if you'd like.  It seems to have been put here for that purpose, but gathering all the breakfast items in your shirt just seems odd.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of eating the breakfast:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">You sit down for a moment and eat breakfast.

It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing the empty dishes from a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.

One really needs to sit down and tuck into it, rather than simply nibbling at one thing or another and leaving the rest of it to repel and disgust another traveller.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The bowl of Lieutenant Chomp is a part-of-a-complete-breakfast on the table.  Understand &quot;<span class="quote">cereal</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">Lieutenant Chomp</span>&quot; as the bowl of Lieutenant Chomp.  The description of the bowl is &quot;<span class="quote">It looks like a bowl filled with the famous cereal known as Lieutenant Chomp.  You grew up seeing the commercials and can almost see the picture of the Lieutenant on the box in your mind's eye.  You know from experience that if you pour the milk too soon before you eat, the cereal will lacerate the roof of your mouth.  If you wait too long: sugary mush.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of smelling the bowl of Lieutenant Chomp, say &quot;<span class="quote">It smells like sugar.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The pitcher of milk is a part-of-a-complete-breakfast on the table.  The description of the pitcher of milk is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a simple, white pitcher of milk, like you'd find in a diner.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of smelling the pitcher of milk, say &quot;<span class="quote">Smells faintly of the sweetness of lactose.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The halved grapefruit is a part-of-a-complete-breakfast on the table. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">membrane</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">sugar</span>&quot; as the grapefruit.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a traditional grapefruit.  It's not one of the slightly sweeter red varieties, and it's not an exotic pomelo.  It looks as if a very thin sprinkling of sugar has been applied.</span>&quot;.  Understand &quot;<span class="quote">fruit</span>&quot; as the grapefruit.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of smelling the halved grapefruit, say &quot;<span class="quote">You can tell the grapefruit was recently cut, since the oils of the peel almost burn your nose with their zinginess.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The soft-boiled egg is a part-of-a-complete-breakfast on the table. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">spoon</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">little spoon</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">holder</span>&quot; as the egg.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The soft-boiled egg is a prim and underappreciated breakfast item.  Sure, it's a lot of work to get to all the egg, but it's a very delicate experience.  You would take the nearby small spoon and gently crack the top of the egg off, exposing the soft and rich partially-cooked egg inside.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of smelling the soft-boiled egg, say &quot;<span class="quote">A soft-boiled egg doesn't smell like much but you can feel the warmth of it on your nose.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The breakfast dishes are on the table.  The breakfast dishes are scenery.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">They are keeping the breakfast from just sitting on the table.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of eating the breakfast dishes, say &quot;<span class="quote">You have gotten everything you wanted from the breakfast dishes.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[lunch]</span></p><p class="indent0">Lunch is on the table.

You can take a moment and eat the lunch if you'd like.  It seems to have been put here for that purpose, but gathering all the lunch items in your shirt just seems odd.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of eating the lunch:</p><p class="indent1">if the breakfast is on the table:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">It doesn't really seem appropriate to just start eating lunch with a perfectly good breakfast sitting there at the same table.  Besides, you're really more in the mood for breakfast.</span>&quot; instead;</p><p class="indent1">else:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">Lunch was wonderful.  Your stomach feels like a puzzle, where the final piece has finally been snapped into place.

One really needs to sit down and tuck into it, rather than simply nibbling at one thing or another and leaving the rest of it to repel and disgust another traveller.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The grilled cheese sandwich is a part-of-a-complete-lunch on the table.  Understand &quot;<span class="quote">bread</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">butter</span>&quot; as the sandwich.  The description of the grilled cheese sandwich is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a grilled cheese sandwich in the classic sense, in that there's nothing in it but cheese.  The sandwich has been cut in half diagonally and the tiniest bit of cheese has oozed out towards the table.  It looks like a combination of cheeses.  The bread is toasted to a perfect golden brown and glistens with its thin layer of butter.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of smelling the grilled cheese sandwich, say &quot;<span class="quote">You mostly smell butter, but perhaps a hint of cheddar.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The bowl of tomato soup is a part-of-a-complete-lunch on the table.  Understand &quot;<span class="quote">pepper</span>&quot; as the soup.  The description of the bowl of tomato soup is &quot;<span class="quote">Warm, creamy, and comforting, and about two thirds the way to filling a fiestaware bowl.  There is a bit of coarsely cracked pepper at the top.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of smelling the bowl of tomato soup, say &quot;<span class="quote">You mostly smell the pepper, but with a warm tomato-ey bottom note.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The description of the tray of antipasto is &quot;<span class="quote">This is an antique bakelite tray containing an assortment of little foods: several different kinds of olives, marinated artichoke hearts, fresh figs, grilled vegetable slices, and cornichon.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of smelling the tray of antipasto, say &quot;<span class="quote">You mostly smell the tartness of the artichoke hearts, but if you lean closely you can smell the cornichon.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The olives are a part-of-a-complete-lunch on the table.  The description of the olives is &quot;<span class="quote">The olives are plain black olives from a can, and green olives with pimentos from a jar.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The fresh figs are a part-of-a-complete-lunch on the table.  The description of the figs is &quot;<span class="quote">The figs look plump and full.  They are greenish-purple.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The grilled vegetable slices are a part-of-a-complete-lunch on the table.  The description of the slices is &quot;<span class="quote">Grilled expertly, with neat grill lines on each side, they've been seared briefly but look as if they still have a little bit of crunch.</span>&quot;  Understand &quot;<span class="quote">vegetables</span>&quot; as the vegetable slices.</p><p class="indent0">The marinated artichoke hearts are a part-of-a-complete-lunch on the table.  The description of the hearts is &quot;<span class="quote">The artichoke hearts sit in a small pool of their own marinade.</span>&quot;  </p><p class="indent0">The cornichon is a part-of-a-complete-lunch on the table.  The description of the cornichon is &quot;<span class="quote">They are tiny french pickles, sweet, like gherkins.  They go well with mustard, but there isn't any.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The ramekin of potato salad is a part-of-a-complete-lunch on the table.  Understand &quot;<span class="quote">potato salad</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class="quote">salad/ramekin/potato/potatoes/potatos/paprika</span>&quot; as the ramekin of potato salad.  The description of the ramekin of potato salad is &quot;<span class="quote">It looks like a well-made potato salad, filled with richness and zing.  You can see flecks of red onion and a light dusting of paprika.  In case you don't know what a ramekin is, it's a small straight-walled bowl with scalloped outside walls. Perfect for an attractive presentation of a small potato salad serving.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of smelling the ramekin of potato salad, say &quot;<span class="quote">Smells like smoked paprika and mustard.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The lunch dishes are on the table.  The lunch dishes are scenery.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">They are keeping the lunch from just sitting on the table.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of eating the lunch dishes, say &quot;<span class="quote">You have gotten everything you wanted from the lunch dishes.</span>&quot;</p>
