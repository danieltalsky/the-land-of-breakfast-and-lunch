<p class="indent0"><span class="heading">Section 2 - The Land of Breakfast and Lunch</span></p><p class="indent0">The Path is a room.  &quot;<span class="quote">You are at the beginning of a path.  It is plain, even homely.  It leads northward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  If you 'walk north' you will follow the path.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Southmostpath is in The Path.  It is scenery.  The description of southmostpath is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a scrubby little path that just kind of tapers off to the south and leads northward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch.  If you 'walk north' you'll be following it.</span>&quot; Understand &quot;<span class="quote">path</span>&quot; as southmostpath.</p><p class="indent0">Check going south:</p><p class="indent1">If the player is in The Path:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">This really is as far south as the path goes.  Further south there's just a bunch of scrub brush as far as the eye can see.  It's really not your kind of thing.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[The Land of Breakfast and Lunch]</span></p><p class="indent0">TLoBL is a room. &quot;<span class="quote">The Land of Breakfast and Lunch is a lot smaller than you were expecting.  It's actually just a small clearing near the road, like a roadside stop, with a painted picnic table containing a simple but nourishing breakfast on one end, and a simple but nourishing lunch on the other end.  A stubby little path leads south, and the path continues to the north, towards The Land of Unrealized Possibilities.  If you 'walk north' you will be walking towards it.</span>&quot;.  TLoBL is north of The Path.</p><p class="indent0">The printed name of TLoBL is &quot;<span class="quote">The Land of Breakfast and Lunch</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">A clearing is in TLoBL.  The clearing is scenery.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The clearing is a small picnic area, intentionally cleared and maintained to allow a person or family to stop by the side of the path and dine.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">A painted picnic table is in TLoBL. The description of the table is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a well-maintained picnic table painted in a bright, childish, civic style, depicting a crude sun with huge yellow beams bathing jagged pine trees in their light.</span>&quot;.  </p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[breakfast]</span></p><p class="indent0">Breakfast is on the table.  It is edible.  The description of breakfast is &quot;<span class="quote">Breakfast consists of a halved grapefruit with the membranes cut for easier eating, a soft-boiled egg in a specially designed holder, and a bowl of Lieutenant Chomp with a small pitcher of milk next to it.</span>&quot;. </p><p class="indent0">Instead of taking the breakfast: say &quot;<span class="quote">The breakfast has several items and is a little unweildy.  You can take a moment and eat the breakfast if you'd like.  It seems to have been put here for that purpose, but gathering all the breakfast items in your shirt just seems odd.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of eating the breakfast:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">You sit down for a moment and eat breakfast.  It is delicious but you still don't quite feel satisfied.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">remove the breakfast from play</p><p class="indent0">A part-of-a-complete-breakfast is a kind of thing. A part-of-a-complete-breakfast is always scenery.  </p><p class="indent0">Instead of eating or taking a part-of-a-complete-breakfast, say &quot;<span class="quote">Breakfast is kind of an all-or-nothing affair.  One really needs to sit down and tuck into it, rather than simply nibbling at one thing or another and leaving the rest of it to repel and disgust another traveller.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The bowl of Lieutenant Chomp is a part-of-a-complete-breakfast on the table.  Understand &quot;<span class="quote">cereal</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">Lieutenant Chomp</span>&quot; as the bowl of Lieutenant Chomp.  The description of the bowl is &quot;<span class="quote">It looks like a bowl filled with the famous cereal known as Lieutenant Chomp.  You grew up seeing the commercials and can almost see the picture of the Lieutenant on the box in your mind's eye.  You know from experience that if you pour the milk too soon before you eat, the cereal will lacerate the roof of your mouth.  If you wait too long: sugary mush.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The pitcher of milk is a part-of-a-complete-breakfast on the table.  The description of the pitcher of milk is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a simple, white pitcher of milk, like you'd find in a diner.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The halved grapefruit is a part-of-a-complete-breakfast on the table. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">membrane</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">sugar</span>&quot; as the grapefruit.  The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a traditional grapefruit.  It's not one of the slightly sweeter red varieties, and it's not an exotic pomelo.  It looks as if a very thin sprinkling of sugar has been applied.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The soft-boiled egg is a part-of-a-complete-breakfast on the table. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">spoon</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">little spoon</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">holder</span>&quot; as the egg.  The description of the egg is &quot;<span class="quote">The soft-boiled egg is a prim and underappreciated breakfast item.  Sure, it's a lot of work to get to all the egg, but it's a very delicate experience.  You take the nearby small spoon, and gently crack the top of the egg off, exposing the soft and rich partially-cooked egg inside. </span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[lunch]</span></p><p class="indent0">Lunch is on the table.  It is edible.  The description of lunch is &quot;<span class="quote">Lunch is made up of a grilled cheese sandwich, a bowl of tomato soup, a small tray of antipasto, and a ramekin filled with a very enticing potato salad.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of taking the lunch: say &quot;<span class="quote">The lunch has several items and is a little unweildy.  You can take a moment and eat the lunch if you'd like.  It seems to have been put here for that purpose, but gathering all the lunch items in your shirt just seems odd.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of eating the lunch:</p><p class="indent1">if the breakfast is on the table:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">It doesn't really seem appropriate to just start eating lunch with a perfectly good breakfast sitting there at the same table.  Besides, you're really more in the mood for breakfast. </span></p><p class="indent2"><span class="quote"></span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">else:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">Lunch was wonderful.  Your stomach feels like a puzzle, where the final piece has finally been snapped into place.  You now feel as if you could take on the world.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent2">remove the lunch from play;</p><p class="indent0">A part-of-a-complete-lunch is a kind of thing. A part-of-a-complete-lunch is always scenery.  </p><p class="indent0">Instead of eating or taking a part-of-a-complete-lunch, say &quot;<span class="quote">Lunch is kind of an all-or-nothing affair.  One really needs to sit down and tuck into it, rather than simply nibbling at one thing or another and leaving the rest of it to repel and disgust another traveller.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The grilled cheese sandwich is a part-of-a-complete-lunch on the table.  Understand &quot;<span class="quote">bread</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">butter</span>&quot; as the sandwich.  The description of the grilled cheese sandwich is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a grilled cheese sandwich in the classic sense, in that there's nothing in it but cheese.  The sandwich has been cut in half diagonally and the tiniest bit of cheese has oozed out towards the table.  It looks like a combination of cheeses.  The bread is toasted to a perfect golden brown and glistens with its thin layer of butter.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The bowl of tomato soup is a part-of-a-complete-lunch on the table.  Understand &quot;<span class="quote">pepper</span>&quot; as the soup.  The description of the bowl of tomato soup is &quot;<span class="quote">Warm, creamy, and comforting, about two thirds the way to filling a fiestaware bowl.  There is a bit of coarsely cracked pepper at the top.</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The tray of antipasto is a part-of-a-complete-lunch on the table.  Understand &quot;<span class="quote">figs</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">fresh figs</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">vegetables</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">grilled vegetable slices</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">olives</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">cornichon</span>&quot; as the tray of antipasto.  The description of the tray of antipasto is &quot;<span class="quote">This is an antique bakelite tray containing an assortment of little foods: several different kinds of olives, marinated artichoke hearts, fresh figs, grilled vegetable slices, and cornichon.</span>&quot;.</p>
