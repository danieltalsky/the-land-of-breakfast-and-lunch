Just being here gives you a sense of all that could be accomplished if enough time, effort, and focus were pointed in a specific direction.  There is an sense of both excitement and disappointment here that is almost palpable.  The Hopeful Path leads southward towards The Land of Breakfast and Lunch, a place with a much clearer sense of purpose.</span>&quot;   TLoUP is north of the hopeful path.</p><p class="indent0">The printed name of TLoUP is &quot;<span class="quote">The Land of Unrealized Possiblities</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">There is a toy box in TLoUP.

The description of the picture is &quot;<span class="quote">You don't remember ever seeing any picture of you like this photo, but this one looks almost exactly other pictures of you at about three.  There is a smile that's a mix of sadness and joy on the child's face.  When you look at it, you can almost feel the feeling.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">There is a small hobby horse in the toy box.   The horse is a supporter.  The description of the horse is &quot;<span class="quote">It is a small, wooden hobby horse.  It's very sturdily built, but made to entertain a three-year old.
